This project is about data extraction from Gmail using its API and then create a CSV.
By now, there is only the extraction code.

To start using, authorize using the API Enable panel in Google Cloud Platform API section and downloading the **client_secret.json** *(MUST BE NAMED LIKE THAT)*

Then just run

    node TextExtraction.js
